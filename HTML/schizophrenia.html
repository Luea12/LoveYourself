<p>Schizophrenia is a serious mental illness characterized by a person experiencing a combination of <b>delusions</b> and <b>hallucinations</b>. Because these delusions and hallucinations feel as real as the world around them, a person with untreated schizophrenia can sometimes have trouble distinguishing actual reality from this altered reality that their brain is telling them.</p>
<br/>
<p>In spite of advances in the understanding of its causes, course, and treatment, schizophrenia continues to be a condition that has been challenging to researchers, clinicians, and those who suffer from it. It is easier for the average person to cope with the idea of cancer than it is to understand the odd behavior, hallucinations, or strange ideas of the person with this condition. People with schizophrenia suffer from some of the greatest prejudice, stigma, and discrimination associated with any mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<br/>
<p>As with most mental disorders, the causes of schizophrenia are still pretty poorly understood. Friends and family commonly are shocked, afraid or angry when they learn of the diagnosis. People often imagine a person with psychosis as being more violent or out-of-control than a person who has another kind of serious mental illness. But these kinds of prejudices and misconceptions can usually be readily corrected.</p>
<br/>
<p>This disorder is better understood as a mental illness that requires ongoing — most often lifetime — treatment. Demystification of the illness, along with recent insights from neuroscience and neuropsychology, gives new hope for finding more effective treatments for an illness that previously carried a grave prognosis.</p>
<br/>
<p>Schizophrenia is characterized by a broad range of unusual behaviors that cause profound disruption in the lives of people suffering from the condition, as well as in the lives of the people around them. This condition can strike anyone without regard to gender, race, social class, or culture and is typically first diagnosed in a person’s 20s.</p>
<br/>
<h3> Symptoms of Schizophrenia </h3>
<p>The symptoms of this condition are fairly easy to recognize, because they stand out so distinctly from a person’s usual behavior. In order for a diagnosis to be made, the person must suffer from two more of the following for at least one month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delusions</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
<li>Incoherent speech or speech that quickly switches topics with little continuity</li>
<li>Problems in their behavior, such as inexplicable agitation or silliness, to catatonic behavior</li>
<li>Negative symptoms characterized by a lack of any emotional expression and/or a lack of purposeful activity (e.g., just sitting with no interest in going to work, school, or engaging in any activities)</li>
</ul>
<p>Delusions are fixed beliefs that don’t change, even when the person is given evidence their beliefs are not based in reality. People can have a variety of delusions, ranging from persecutory (<i>“people are going to harm me”</i>) and referential (<i>“people are sending me secret signals”</i>) to grandiose (<i>“I am wealthy and famous and known around the world”</i>), erotomanic (<i>“I know that person is in love with me”</i>), nihilistic (<i>“the end of the world is coming!”</i>), and somatic (<i>“my liver can transform any poison into a harmless substance”</i>). Delusions may also be considered bizarre if they have no connection to reality in the same kind of culture the person was raised in.</p>
<br/>
<p>Hallucinations, according to the American Psychiatric Association (2013), are experiencing something in one’s perception, but without the necessary external stimuli being available — like seeing something that isn’t really there. These unreal perceptions can occur in any of a person’s senses, but most often occur as auditory hallucinations.</p>
