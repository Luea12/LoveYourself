<p>Sometimes, life changes. Overnight or in a split second. Nothing is ever, ever the same again. You begin to date your life “BC” and “AD.” Before the life-changing event and after it. Life has splintered. Shattered.</p>
<br/>
<p>It’s rather like my parents’ generation asking each other, “Where were you when you heard Kennedy had been shot?” For my generation it’s “Where were you when the towers fell on 9/11?” For some, they’ll never forget where they were when they heard that the Big Bopper, Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens had perished in a plane crash, an event that inspired one of my favorite songs, <cite>American Pie</cite>.</p>
<br/>
<blockquote cite="American Pie - Don McLean">
Bye, bye Miss American Pie
<br/>
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
<br/>
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
<br/>
Singin’ this’ll be the day that I die
<br/>
This’ll be the day that I die
