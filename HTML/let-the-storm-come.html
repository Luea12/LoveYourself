<p>Have you ever started into a day that you know is going to be bad?Of course you have. We all have. And you’ve even sometimes known it was going to be bad without knowing fully just why that was or how bad it was going to be. And when you don’t know how bad it’s going to be, it always feels like it’s going to be worse than it ever was before … </p>
<br/>
<h4>Mystery is madness</h4>
<br/>
<p> We all know that fear of the unknown is the worst fear of all. Our minds are the sky and the sky is the limit to the horrors we imagine are coming. And with ADHD in our CV, we have the added problem of believing that the day will never end. </p>
<br/>
<h4>Time to stop and think</h4>
<br/>
<p>We, the people with ADHD, have a difficult time with the concept of time. We know there is “now” and we know there is “not now” and we know that we have never experienced the “not now” first hand. Time is not on our side.If we are feeling caged, caught, or in danger right now, there is only right now. If we are facing a day that seems like it is going to be a long hard slog, than our current and soon to be “now” is all that we can imagine in our lives. </p>
<br/>
<h4>That old hyper-focus thingy</h4>
<br/>
<p>Sometimes we call that a blessing, but we all know it can be a curse. It was the thing that made us watch hours of TV as kids, when we knew we had hours of homework to do. And it’s the thing that will not allow us to dwell on anything but the current issues.</p>
<br/>
<h4>But there’s two “not nows”</h4>
<br/>
<p>There is the “not now” we have yet to experience, and there’s the one that we call the past, as foggy as it can be sometimes. And if the past has taught me anything, it’s that the present will eventually pass. We just won’t notice it because we’re always in the now, even if we’re daydreaming. </p>
<br/>
<h4>So …</h4>
<br/>
<p>I have started to practice a sort of Zen kind of time management. Well, it’s not really a way of managing time so much as it’s a way of dealing with it. I have realized from the past that the present will eventually become the present me’s future. Confusing? Yes. Why do you think it took me nearly sixty years to figure it out? </p>
<br/>
<h4>I say … </h4>
<br/>
<p>“Let the storm come.” But I also say, “Let the storm pass.”. I do my best to deal, but I leave the anxiety behind to the best of my ability. I know I can’t just coast through things without worrying, but I find I can often reduce the worry to manageable amounts and get my sorry self through the melee.</p>
<br/>
<h4>So I’m telling you now</h4>
<br/>
<p>Quit wasting time worrying about the storm, let it come.</p>
<br/>
<p>And then let it pass.</p>
<br/>
<p>And then think about what you have accomplished and be proud.</p>
<br/>
<p>You’ve got this.</p>
