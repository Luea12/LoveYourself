<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a mental disorder whose main symptoms include <b>obsessions</b> and <b>compulsions</b>, driving the person to engage in unwanted, oftentimes distress behaviors or thoughts. It is treated through a combination of psychiatric medications and psychotherapy.</p>
<br/>
<p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (<abbr>OCD</abbr>) is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent and disturbing thoughts (called obsessions) and/or repetitive, ritualized behaviors that the person feels driven to perform (called compulsions). Obsessions can also take the form of intrusive images or unwanted impulses. The majority of people with <abbr>OCD</abbr> have both obsessions and compulsions, but a minority (about 20 percent) have obsessions alone or compulsions alone (about 10 percent).<p>
<br/>
<p>The person with <abbr>OCD</abbr> usually tries to actively dismiss the obsessions or neutralize them by engaging in compulsions or avoiding situations that trigger them. In most cases, compulsions serve to alleviate anxiety. However, it is not uncommon for the compulsions themselves to cause anxiety — especially when they become very demanding.</p>
<br/>
<p>A hallmark of <abbr>OCD</abbr> is that the person recognizes that their thoughts or behaviors are senseless or excessive.</p>
<br/>
<p>However, the drive can be so powerful that the person caves in to the compulsion even though they know it makes no sense. One woman spent hours each evening sifting through the household trash to ensure that nothing valuable was being discarded. When asked what she was looking for, she nervously admitted, “I have no idea, I don’t own anything valuable.”</p>
<br/>
<p>Some people who have had <abbr>OCD</abbr> for a long time may stop resisting their compulsive drives because they feel it’s just easier to give in to them.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Examples of Compulsions</h3>
<p>Common compulsions include excessive cleaning (e.g., ritualized hand washing); checking, ordering, and arranging rituals; counting; repeating routine activities (e.g., going in/out of a doorway) and hoarding (e.g., collecting useless items). While most compulsions are observable behaviors (e.g., hand washing), some are performed as unobservable mental rituals (e.g., silent recitation of nonsense words to vanquish a horrific image).</p>
<br/>
<h3>Examples of Obsessions</h3>
<p>Common types of obsessions include concerns with contamination (e.g., fear of dirt, germs or illness), safety/harm (e.g., being responsible for a fire), unwanted acts of aggression (e.g., unwanted impulse to harm a loved one), unacceptable sexual or religious thoughts (e.g., sacrilegious images of Christ) and the need for symmetry or exactness.</p>
<br/>
<p>Most <abbr>OCD</abbr> sufferers have multiple types of obsession and compulsion. Someone with <abbr>OCD</abbr>may complain primarily of obsessive-compulsive symptoms involving asbestos contamination, but a detailed interview may disclose that he/she silently counts floor tiles and hoards junk mail.</p>
