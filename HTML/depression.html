<p>Clinical depression goes by many names, such as “the blues,” biological depression, and major depression. But all of these names refer to the same thing: feeling <b>sad</b> and <b>depressed</b> for weeks or months on end — not just a passing blue mood of a day or two. This feeling is most often accompanied by a sense of hopelessness, a lack of energy (or feeling “weighed down”), and taking little or no pleasure in things that once gave a person joy in the past.</p>
<br/>
 <p>Depression symptoms take many forms, and no two people’s experiences are exactly alike. A person who’s suffering from this disorder may not seem sad to others. They may instead complain about how they just “can’t get moving,” or are feeling completely unmotivated to do just about anything. Even simple things — like getting dressed in the morning or eating at mealtime — become large obstacles in daily life. People around them, such as their friends and family, notice the change too. Often they want to help, but just don’t know how.</p>
<br/>
 <p>Clinical depression is different from normal sadness — like when you lose a loved one — as it usually completely consumes a person in their day-to-day living. It doesn’t stop after just a day or two — it will continue for weeks on end, interfering with the person’s work or school, their relationships with others, and their ability to just enjoy life and have fun. Some people feel as if a huge hole of emptiness has opened inside when experiencing the hopelessness associated with this condition. In any given year, 7 percent of Americans will be diagnosed with this condition; women are 2 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed than men <small>(American Psychiatric Association)</small>.</p>
<br/>
<p>The symptoms of depression include the majority of the following signs, experienced more days than not over the course of two or more weeks: a persistent feeling of loneliness or sadness; lack of energy; feelings of hopelessness; difficulties with sleeping; difficulties with eating; difficulties with concentration or attention; total loss of interest in enjoyable activities or socializing; feelings of guilt and worthlessness; and/or thoughts of death or suicide. Most people who are feeling depressed don’t experience every symptom, and the presentation of symptoms varies in degree and intensity from person to person.</p>
