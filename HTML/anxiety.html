<p>Generalized anxiety disorder (<abbr>GAD</abbr>) is more than the normal anxiety people experience day to day. It’s chronic and exaggerated <b>worry</b> and <b>tension</b>, even though nothing seems to provoke it. Having this disorder means always anticipating disaster, often worrying excessively about health, money, family, or work. Sometimes, though, the source of the worry is hard to pinpoint.</p>
<br/>
<p>Simply the thought of getting through the day provokes anxiety.</p>
<br/>
<p>People with <abbr>GAD</abbr> can’t seem to shake their concerns, even though they usually realize that their anxiety is more intense than the situation warrants — that it’s irrational. People with <abbr>GAD</abbr> also seem unable to relax. They often have trouble falling or staying asleep. Their worries are accompanied by physical symptoms, especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating, or hot flashes. They may feel lightheaded or out of breath. They may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently. Or they might feel as though they have a lump in the throat.</p>
<br/>
<p>Many individuals with <abbr>GAD</abbr> startle more easily than other people. They tend to feel tired, have trouble concentrating, and sometimes suffer depression, too.</p>
<br/>
<p>Usually the impairment associated with <abbr>GAD</abbr> is mild and people with the disorder don’t feel too restricted in social settings or on the job. Unlike many other anxiety disorders, people with <abbr>GAD</abbr> don’t characteristically avoid certain situations as a result of their disorder. However, if severe, <abbr>GAD</abbr> can be very debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities.</p>
<br/>
<p><abbr>GAD</abbr> comes on gradually and most often hits people in childhood or adolescence, but can begin in adulthood, too. It’s more common in women than in men and often occurs in relatives of affected persons. It’s diagnosed when someone spends at least 6 months worried excessively about a number of everyday problems.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Specific Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h3>
<p>Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) occur more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).</p>
<br/>
<p>The person finds it difficult to control the worry.</p>
<br/>
<p>The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months; children do not need to meet as many criteria–only 1 is needed).</p>
<ul>
<li>Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge</li>
<li>Being easily fatigued</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Muscle tension</li>
<li>Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless unsatisfying sleep)</li>
</ul>
