<p> Bipolar disorder symptoms are characterized by a cycling of <b>mood swings</b> between feelings of great energy and activity (known as manic or hypomania) and feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and being blue (known as depression). Bipolar symptoms come in cycles, which tend to last anywhere from days to months at a time. </p>
<br/>
<p>This condition is diagnosed according to the criteria listed in the diagnostic reference manual published by the American Psychiatric Association (2013):</p>
<br/>
<section>
<h3>Bipolar I Disorder</h3>
<p>The essential feature of Bipolar I is that the person experiences one full manic episode (though the manic episode may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes).</p>
<br/>
<p>A manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an abnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three additional symptoms of mania.</p>
<br/>
<p>The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episodes is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.</p>
</section>
<br/>
<section>
<h3>Bipolar II Disorder</h3>
<p>Bipolar II requires occurrence (or history) of one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode. Additionally, there has never been a full manic episode. A hypomanic episode lasts for at least four (4) or more consecutive days, and shares the same symptoms as a full manic episode.</p>
</section>
<p>In both bipolar I and II disorders, a person can have a mood episode (i.e., primarily manic or depressed) with mixed features, wherein a manic/hypomanic episode there are significant depressive symptoms, and in a depressive episode there are some manic/hypomanic symptoms.</p>
